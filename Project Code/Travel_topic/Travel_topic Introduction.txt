Introduction
For tourism, we divide the code into two parts, the model part, and the visualization part.

Dataset
LSTM&Attention Model Folder
1. "0421_travel.xlsx": This xlsx file contains monthly data for short-term visitors arriving in the NSW region from January 1991 to February 2023
2. "LSTM_Baseline.py": This py file is the model analysis of the sequence data above using the LSTM-transformer model as the baseline of our project.
3. "main_attention.py": This py file is the model analysis of the sequence data above using the Attention-transformer model as an improved method for our project.
4. "test.py": This py file is the test results of the data from 2015 to 2019 using the LSTM-transformer model and the Attention-transformer model.
5. "ConvTransformer_nologsparse.pth" saves the parameters we use for the Attention-transformer model.

Visualization Folder
python sub-Folder
1. "0421_travel.xlsx": This xlsx file contains monthly data for short-term visitors arriving in the NSW region from January 1991 to February 2023
2. "Autocorrelation&test visualization.ipynb": This ipynb file contains the autocorrelation visualization of the data and the visualization of the test part of the two models
3. "baseline_test.xlsx": This xlsx file contains the prediction results of the LSTM-transformer model for 2015-2019
4. "transformer_test.xlsx": This xlsx file contains the prediction results of the Attention-transformer model for 2015-2019.
R sub-Folder
1. "Travel Visualization.Rmd": This Rmd file contains our visual forecast results and other related pictures for the number of tourists arriving in the NSW region in the next ten years


Instructions for Opening the File
1. Open "LSTM_Baseline.py," "main_attention.py," "test.py," "Autocorrelation&test visualization.ipynb", "Travel Visualization.Rmd" and run them to output the results of the model
