Business_close_topic Introduction

For the topic of the tourism problem, we analyze it based on Python software.
In this part, we try to use the model to analyze the short-term tourist data arriving in
the NSW region from 1991 to the present, train the model and use the fitted model to
predict the number of tourists coming into the NSW region in the future and give the
government a benchmark in the future to help the government analyze the current
situation recovery of the tourism industry. Before model fitting, we performed an
autocorrelation analysis on our time series data to confirm the most suitable training
step size. Then we used the LSTM-Transformer and Encoder-Decoder-Transformer
models to model and analyze this problem. The data in the training set is from 1991
to before the covid-19. This period of data includes data from the SARS period,
which can help the model understand the impact of the epidemic to a certain extent
and more accurately predict the number of tourists in the future
