Project Abstract

In our project, we have two branches of topics, travel and business close, and our code will be divided into 
two folders for display. I am the creator of the PowerPoint presentations, tableau dashboards, and the 
organizer of all the meetings with NSW Service and our teammates. I am also the coauthor of all the relevant 
coding work.

This project aims to develop different methods to forecast the impact caused by
COVID-19 with its recovery and measure the effectiveness of the support provided
on COVID-19 for the NSW service, which are the two main topics of this project:
COVID-19 impact & recovery forecast for the Tourism problem, and the business
close support success measurement for the business close problem. The methods
applied include different types of forecasting models, business analysis & data
visualization, and automated visualization generation for BA and DA. The final
findings and results generated by these methods could provide data-driven
decision-making recommendations to the NSW Service regarding the COVID-19
support policy development and justification, and the practical guidelines to measure
the success of the support provided. Moreover, the data and business analysis
methods of this project could be utilized to solve problems in the real world such as
disaster impact & recovery forecasting, and the effectiveness of the supports on the
disaster measurement, which helps the local government to make decisions on the
disaster forecast, recovery, and support problem.
